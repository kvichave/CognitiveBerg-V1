I am creating a educational web application, where a user can get hands on experience of virtual interview, business meeting, personal communication , when the user starts a meeting eg- interview meeting, he will get 3 Virtual interviewer which is generated by Gemini api, these virtual interviewers will start the communication with the user and create a near to real experience with the user by using speech module (whisper ai)


I will create this project on fastapi/flask, next.js 




1) creating a trained gemini model on custom data set of interview questions
2) for speech to text use whisper Ai
3) fast api to develop the application
4) Coqui-TTS for text to speech
