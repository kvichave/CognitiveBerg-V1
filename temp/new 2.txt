 Hello everyone, we are LinkedIn Park. Our browser statement is development of AI ML solution for facewap based peak technologies. As we know that AI is in its peak right now, we can make deepfake videos on the internet using artificial intelligence under immunization. So it's getting out of high. Here is our solution. We are using face net model which is provided by Google itself. It detects face. So we have combined the code with face net model and our model actually Checks whether the video is fake or real. We have used streamlit website for the interface You have to browse the files and then upload the video and then our model runs and checks them whether the video is fake or real It and it analyzes the movement of the face whether it matches with the audio or not it analyzes the inconsistencies in the base and the result shows whether the Video is fake or not. Our model accuracy is a lot more than what we get on the internet right now. Thank you.
